Puppy Restaurant:

created a website as a team based on the demo given to us

Peer Review: Roy Cade III (Trey)
The only things I could find are pretty nit picky but for desktop on the catering page the main text box could be re-sized to fit the same height as the picture next to it. For tablet some width changes could be made to make it look more cohesive in the menu, catering, landing and menu pages. Lastly the main top picture disappears after 768px width I dont know if it was intentional or accidental I just noticed it. Otherwise I really like how they made use of carousels in their about and menu pages on tablet, thought that was pretty cool.




Note:Desktop breakpoint 1920
